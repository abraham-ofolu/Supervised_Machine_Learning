# Supervised_Machine_Learning

Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market.


# BACKGROUND

I will be using the data provided to create machine learning models to classify the risk of given loans.

And will also be comparing between the Logistic Regression Model and Random Forest Classifier.

# INSTRUCTIONS

# Retrieving the Data

The Date is located in my Resources folder 

- ./Resources/lending_data.csv

i have imported the data using pandas, and also using matplotlib for plotting. 

# CONSIDER THE MODELS

You will be creating and comparing two models on this data: a Logistic Regression, and a Random Forests Classifier.

# FIT A LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL AND RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER MODEL. 

Create a LogisticRegression model, fit it to the data, and print the model's score. Do the same for a RandomForestClassifier. You may choose any starting hyperparameters you like. Which model performed better? How does that compare to your prediction? Write down your results and thoughts.
